There are many who have a sense of urgency, quietly watching how things develop,you are dragons coiling, you are tigers crouching, I admire noble-minded patriots.
Has history given us too many lessons?, 530, 412, 64
taking a look
the ones who are suffering are the ordinary people: even if the body of a salted fish is turned over, it is still a salted fish ...
Freedom of speech\thought, if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view, and put forward slightly different criticism, then they are called slaves of foreigners, or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things,
What is more they are considered traitors of China, which is a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism.
In fact, the US no longer needs to use force to deal with China, they have achieved the result of "defeating enemy soldiers without fighting".
Is the article too intense, is the United States so good?
If things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself, do not assume their existence, three people create a tiger.
Just passing by and taking a look. Won't express my opinion
Came to study and learn
Very attractive
It should vigorously advocated
Some people - don't forget you are Chinese; if the country needs me, I'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness!
I really especially hate those who are eating Chinese things and drinking Chinese things, but who say America is so whatever, those dogs, if America is so good go find your American illegitimate fathers
I feel our people should learn more from the DPRK, the banner of socialism needs to be held, but Mao Zedong Thought can't be forgotten!
Only Mao Zedong Thought, can save the nation!
There too many traitors of China!
Patriotism is the bottom line. Everyone must prove worthy of the nation
I think it is not those elites, but that some corrupt officials were bribed
Remove this group of jerks!
I'm just taking a look
There are so many traitors in the history of China - we need to be vigilant.
With the chaos in East and North Africa, we also had no choice but to prevent the running dog traitors from colluding with Western imperialism.
Everything has its set number, it 's not time for a change in the weather in China, traitors can only bark madly like dogs and nothing else, can only make them disappointed.
It won't be long until people are coming from all directions to the Chinese court. Leading the world. This is the intent of heaven.
Following with interest.
This just is a specialty of modern China there's nothing we can do
There are too many traitors among our compatriots,
Freedom of speech is relative. We need take national conditions into account.
Freedom of speech\thought, if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view, and put forward slightly different criticism, then they are called slaves of foreigners, or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things,
to the person who said this I'd like to ask which one of those mentioned above is your dad

In critical moments, we are all descendants of Yan emperor and Huang emperor.
Look at the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation of those years and you will know ...
In the peaceful years, creating a ruckus doesn't influence everybody cooperating when it's time for war ...
It can compete with articles from the Cultural Revolution, magnifying a problem to become a question of principle or of ideological line, buttoning the hat.
the fifth column will make those with vested interests in the Communist Party terrified, it's a good thing
If you want to destroy a people, first of all is his national culture, whose tool is language and writing. Currently the one which everyone who is going to the next grade or entering a higher school must all be tested on is English-
-turn
you are a dragon coiling, you are a tiger crouching, it makes sense, wait for the opportunity
In fact, US no longer needs to use force to deal with China, they have reached a result of "defeating enemy soldiers without fighting" ...
Yes. There are many slaves of foreigners. It's time we should renovate!
The ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of China! Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said that the Communist Party will not be overthrown - if it falls, it will be brought down from within the party itself. Former US Ambassador to China Mr. Huntsman once said in a speech in the US: we will raise eight hundred thousand spokespeople in China, let the Chinese themselves topple China - and the CIA then used an annual eight million yuan subsidy to help these domestic so-called elite, vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically, citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us.
I have reasons to say this: these last several days I have seen the suggestions given by the experts - with a glimpse I see they are disciples of Wang Jingwei!
Western society allows these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy.
The domestic political development is truly too slow, being criticized by people whose ideology is a bit advanced is inevitable. Can we blame others for this?
Saying that someone is bribed is improper?
People are all selfish, reality also is often gray.
Some propaganda activities of ZF have soon become viewed as jokes by the people.
In this environment, what's wrong if they criticize the previous stupefying propaganda a bit?
We can't look over the old accounts of the previous so-called anti-Japanese war.
Take a look at North Korea, that's our country many years ago. Take a look at their ridiculous propaganda.
The United States' dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped, it is constantly being planned.
These days, there's a kind of feeling that's more and more intense: It's that America, through long-term bribing of the Chinese intellectual elite has already succeeded in setting up a "fifth column".
These people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position, and are distributed in various circles in society, taking great pains to promote American values* and brainwash the Chinese people on behalf of the Americans.
Why is this kind of feeling getting more and more intense?
Because these days, I've been reading part of the "Specialist Professor" blog, it would have been okay if I didn't read it, but after I read it, it made me really surprised.
For example, Assistant Professor Zhang Ming of Renmin University, the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious.
Such as, in one blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in China to elementary school textbooks having "Wang Erxiao", and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny.
Another example is so-called "sexologist" and "social activist" Li Yinhe - one, her stuff is not similar to things like the treatise "Haite Sexology Report"; two, she has no deep thought; and three, she has no significant contributions.
She main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people's eyes, but without real ability or learning, she's purely a jumping clown,
This kind of person puts on the big "specialist" hat just to intimidate people; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet doesn't understand politics, is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing, is ignorant yet feels fine.
Like in the essay "A bit less hostility, a bit more harmony", she completely denigrates class struggle and the anti-pornography-and-illegal-publications drive as social hostility;
in the essay "China has already become the country which worships money most on the earth", she attributes Chinese society's worship of money to atheism;
the essay "Are you studying Paul or studying Bill?", she blathers that "people who study Paul will become terrorists";
in the essay "Recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products", she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech, and says the Beijing anti-pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior, etc.
Especially today's masterpiece, "Why is it worth paying such close attention to the Jianghe obscene goods case?", where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by Beijing City, as well as detailing a list of erotic products, with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people."
But these kind of jerky articles actually being put on top by Sina blog is really preposterous!
And there is also Sichuanese poet Liu Shahe, who, while America clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of China and the people of the whole nation are feeling indignant, actually comes out with the fallacy "China and America are friendly", and tries to pour spirit-confusing soup on the Chinese people willfully and without fear;
Yi Zhongtian,who got famous by remarking upon the "three countries", whose talent and learning I have always respected, but I didn't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of China, Mao Yushi, saying some things like "I believe whoever disrespects Mao Yushi is not human", once again making me very much drop my glasses!
Also, as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago "Complete notes on 100 Chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the Ford Foundation", I feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in China who are "becoming treasonous" are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear, to a level of publicly harming the country.
But I do not understand, when these people frequently make treasonous remarks, why no one curbs them and they, moreover, can continue to occupy high positions, calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion?
Contacting "Southern newspapers", which were temporarily fierce a short while ago, I feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personalities!
I remember, 60-some years ago the US had just fought a war with China, and still threatened China with the use of nuclear weapons;
40-some years ago, the US entered Vietnam with the intention of containing China;
although 32 years ago it had established relations with China, 22 years ago it again started imposing sanctions on China, 12 years ago it bombed a Chinese embassy, 10 years ago the South China Sea collision incident occurred, and two years ago it restarted its containment of China with great fanfare.
I don't understand, why are we Chinese so forgetful?
Why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the US?
Without taking a big loss, people don't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us Chinese.
Therefore, it also stands to reason that the forces of the traitors of China are rampaging and the fifth column is running rampant
It's entirely possible - don't we ourselves raise "traitors to China" among primary school students?

Passing through ...
Mr. Zhengqing, the things you say are quite astonishing, there possibly is a suspicion that there are fragments , even if they are a fifth column, they wouldn't be so bare-boned, we should allow the existence of different opinions, the times are really different, no matter if its democracy or pan-Occidentalism, neither are beneficial to China, don't be afraid, what do you say

Little Japan, born of dog feces and the dead US economy almost can't survive. They are preparing to start a war, to pass on debt to others.
China can not be so " Doctrine of the Mean"~
If we greatly value making peace with wolves, we will pay a painful price!
If we act like a turtle, will the various powers let us off? It's time to abolish cultural troupes and sports teams! Use the funds on the front-line of defense.
Looking the territorial seas with smoke of beacon-fires up everywhere, what can being a great sports and arts nation accomplish?
It's time to wake up! The wrong thinking and policies of high-level decision-making should be amended
We should put our efforts to developing science and technology; we will be beaten if left behind; use the limited military expenses on commanders and soldiers on the front line!
Mister, if the Diaoyu Islands are ours, please prove it with actions
